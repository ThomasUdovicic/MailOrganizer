A simple organizer to move all promotional emails you get, that include an unsubscribe button, to the trash. 
It also adds all the unsubscribe links to a single csv file, so you can easily unsubscribe from all the mail lists.
It a WIP, so if you want to use it, you have to set up your own Google Cloud Service account, in order to use the Google GMail API.
